Here's the repository for us. We can update the README to something more specific. I just want to practice using the GUI.

The primary question for this analysis emanates from one of the major categorical justifications for aid as a foriegn policy tool. A major official justification/purpose for US aid (both economic and military), according to most official publications, is to ensure global stability and peace. Springing from this, we ask the questions listed herewith. 
	 
We will use two main data sets: Data pertaining to US Foreign Aid, garnered from USAID and data on “Political Stability and Absence of Violence” from the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators. We will also use data on selected country population and GDP. 
The data for our analysis would cover the time range 2002 to 2017) 


Enquiries need out of the questions below:
Primary question: Are US aid contributions to Sub-Saharan Africa proactive or reactive?

What is the relationship between a country’s stability level/rank and the amount of aid they receive? (Combined, military, economic)
Country stability ranking
Amount of US aid received. 
 
  What trends exist in terms of military vs. economic aid (what percentage of aid is military vs economic)? (Country/year). Is there a difference in the pattern of aid-stability index between military and economic aid. 
Country stability ranking
Economic aid per country
Military aid per country

What patterns do we see in terms of stability levels over time compared with the amount of aid given? 

If there is a randomness in the aid-stability correlation, what possible factors might explain it? 
Come up with possible explanations for the scenario 

What trends exist in terms of aid given compared to population (per capita aid)? Compared to GDP? 
Stability ranking
National population
GDP

For this project, we will examine the relationship between US foreign aid to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and levels of political stability in those countries. We recognize that stability is a subjective term and have chosen to focus on “Political Stability and Absence of Violence,” as defined by the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators.
