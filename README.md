For this project, we examined the relationship between amount of foreign aid given to countries in the sub-Saharan African region and several World Bank indicators for those countries. We specifically looked for correlations between both economic and military aid and political stability, GDP, infant mortality, and population in each country. 

Our data for US Aid came from USAID.gov. Our data on World Bank indicators came from Worldbank.org. 

All members worked on multiple aspects of the assignment. Primary contributions are below. 

Julia Sweet: created starter code for using WBPY and found indicator codes (used in many comparisons); worked on aid and infant mortality exploration, analysis, and visualization

Ricardo Bonner: starter code for comparisons and regressions (used in comparisons); aid and stability exploration, analysis, and visualization; compiled PowerPoint

Venkata Priyanka Sagi: worked on aid and GDP exploration, analysis, and visualization

Eddie Freier: cleaned USAID data and created Excel files with narrowed data (used in all comparisons), collaborated with Kingsford on pie chart on total aid given to region during years 2002-2017, collaborated with Kingsford on comparison of total aid to population

Wondwossen Abatheneh: idea for project, exploration of population

Kingsford Brown Dadzie: Soucres out Population data (SAA) form the Worldbank  and also collaborated with Eddie no pie chart on total aid given to the region within the years 2002-2017. Also collaborated with Eddie on comparison of total aid to population using scatter plots as the visualization.
