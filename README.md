For this project, we examined the relationship between amount of foreign aid given to countries in the sub-Saharan African region and several World Bank indicators for those countries. We specifically looked for correlations between both economic and military aid and political stability, GDP, infant mortality, and population in each country. 

Our data for US Aid came from 


to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and levels of political stability in those countries. We recognize that stability is a subjective term and have chosen to focus on “Political Stability and Absence of Violence,” as defined by the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators. Documentation for that source is found here: https://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#doc

We also examined correlations between amounts of aid and infant mortality, GDP, and population of a country.
