For this project, we examined the relationship between amount of foreign aid given to countries in the sub-Saharan African region and several World Bank indicators for those countries. We specifically looked for correlations between both economic and military aid and political stability, GDP, infant mortality, and population in each country. 

Our data for US Aid came from USAID.gov. Our data on World Bank indicators came from Worldbank.org.
